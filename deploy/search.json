    "text": "Abstract\nUlva species play important roles in coastal ecosystems and the global mariculture industry, both for direct human consumption and their potential role as efficient biofilter. However, the identification of Ulva species remains challenging due to their simple morphologies and intraspecific and interspecific overlaps between those morphological characters that are classically used for species delimitation. In addition, currently used molecular markers (ITS, rbcL, tufA) fail to reliably separate Ulva species. Phylogenies reconstructed from either the chloroplast or the mitochondrial genomes yield contrasting results. Various academic, ecological and industrial communities could benefit from a reliable, quick and cheap way to delimit Ulva species, which is currently lacking. In this study, we present a resolved Ulva species tree based on the combined information gathered from 70 chloroplast and 29 mitochondrial protein-coding genes from 49 Ulva isolates belonging to more than 15 Ulva species. We also performed a rigorous genomic comparison of all high quality Ulva organelles sequences available to confirm that genomic signatures segregate according to the species tree we reconstructed. Then, we developed a novel combinatorial approach that tested 945 unique combinations of chloroplast and mitochondrial genes (up to 10 distinct organellar genes) to identify a minimum set of organellar molecular markers necessary to resolve Ulva phylogeny at the species level (universal Ulva species markers). We suggest the combination of the following chloroplast and mitochondrial genes as the minimum set of organellar molecular markers sufficient to discriminate Ulva at the species level: psaA, psbD, cox1 and cox2. Interestingly, chloroplast markers commonly used for Ulva species delimitation (i.e.: rbcL and tufA) showed a reduced resolution power compared to psaA and psbD and resulted in a phylogenetic tree more distant to the Ulva species tree we reconstructed. We further confirmed the resolution power of the proposed universal markers by designing primers and correctly characterizing Ulva specimens for which whole organellar genomes are not available. In addition to describing a rigorous approach for species resolution in green seaweeds based on organellar markers, we provide a useful resource for researchers and conservation ecologists and promote the selection of Ulva species for mariculture applications worldwide.",

    "text": "Here we explore the data availability of The Cancer Genome Atlas public resource.\nWe explore the available clinical metadata for each cancer patient.\nWe explore the cohort demographic information.\n\n\n1.1.1 Prognosis Outcome\nOf the 887 petients with kidney tumor, 659 were alive at the time of the last check up, while 228 died. It appears that KIRC patients (48.7% dead) have worse prognosis than KIRP patients (17.9% dead), as observed in the previous comparisons. However, before drawing a formal conclusion, we should validate this observation at least in another independent cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gene matrix occupancy and gene length distribution across organellar genomes included in this study are presented in Fig. S2. Most selected genes are present/ nearly present in all studied sequences. In 29 selected genes for mitochondrial, there are two genes, rps3 and rps4 that are not presented in more than 10% of the 37 mt genomic sequences. For chloroplast, there are 10 out of 70 genes not presented in more than 10% of the 34 cp genomic sequences. The gene length distribution for cp and mt genes are …mean/median (range)…, respectively. Trees estimated by the ML and coalescent methods were well-supported and congruent, although slightly different topologies were recovered for different methods applied for different datasets (cp, mt and cp+mt) (Fig.1, Fig. S3). For the cp+mt tree, the topology of ML and coalescent trees are mostly congruent. The difference in the topology happens mostly within large species clades, e.g., clade contains U. australis or U. compressa genomes. The notorious difference is the position of U.fene vs. Ulva sp4. The results from the correlation between the common nodes and MAST% are highly concordant. They indicate that the topology of phylogenetic trees constructed by the two methods (ML and coalescence) and different datasets (cp, mt and cp+mt) is highly similar, except for the topology of the mt phylogenetic tree constructed by the ML method (The correlation between the common nodes) and the coalescent method (MAST%). Results from RF and KF matrices are more varied, but both also show the topology of species tree constructed using mt genomes ML is less similar compared to other species trees.\nFigure 1. (A). Consensus Ulva species tree based on the (49) concatenated chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. The colors of circle at each node show the confident level of supporting values (bootstrap value for ML tree and posterior value for coalescence tree). Black circles indicate nodes with at least 95% support while grey circles indicate nodes with support values in the range of 75-95% and white circles indicate nodes with support values less than 75%. The blue lines show the identical topology between ML and coalescence tree while grey lines indicate difference in topology within species and red lines indicate difference in topology between species. (B). Four metrics, namely the correlation between the common nodes (common_nodes_corr), Robinson-Foulds (RF), Kuhner-Felsenstein (KF), and Maximum Agreement Subtree (MAST) used to assess the concordance of the Ulva species tree reconstructed from supermatrix and coalescence-based analyses obtained from the analyses of chloroplast genes, mitochondrial genes and chloroplast and mitochondrial genes. Higher values in correlation between the common_nodes_corr and MAST indicate the higher similarity between topology while lower values in correlation between the RF and KF indicate the higher similarity between topology.\nAmong the 70 cp genes chosen, the four indices RF, KF, MAST and the correlation between the common nodes metrics pointed out 24 unique cp genes that provide the most similar topology compared to the species tree constructed using 70 genes, namely accD, atpF, chlI, petB, psaA, psaB, psbB, psbD, rpl12, rpl19, rpl2, rpl32, rpoA, rpoB, rpoC1, rpoC2, rps12, rps2, rps4, rps8, rps9, tufA, ycf1, and ycf20 (Table 1). Among them, several genes such as psaA, psaB, and psbB are consistently identified by different matrices. Similarly, the same approach applied to the Ulva species trees reconstructed using mt suggested 19 unique mt genes, namely atp1, atp6, cob, cox1, cox2, cox3, nad2, nad4, nad5, nad7, rpl14, rpl16, rps10, rps11, rps14, rps19, rps2, rps3, and rps4, of which several genes such as atp6, cox1, cox2, rps3, and rps10 are suggested by different indices. Since the Ulva specimens used in this study do not always have both cp and mt genomes, the Ulva species trees reconstructed using cp and mt supermatrix have different set of tips, depending on the availability of the genomes. Prior analyses suggested that MAST% and common correlation nodes metrics are the best performers to assess phylogenetic tree distances when the tree do not have the same set of tips, we then selected (arbitrarily) 10 genes for the combinatorial approach, petB, psaA, psaB, psbB, psbD, rps2, atp6, cox1, cox2, and mt_rps3, based on the top 10 single gene ML trees with topology closest to cp_mt_ML. The first six genes are cp genes while the other four genes are mt genes.\nFrom the combination of 2 to 10 selected genes, 1,013 species trees were generated (45 species trees for 2 genes, 120 species trees for 3 genes, 210 species trees for 4 genes, 252 species trees for 5 genes,210 species trees for 6 genes, 120 species trees for 7 genes, 45 species trees for 8 genes, 10 species trees for 9 genes and 1 species trees for 10 genes). After filtering for combinations containing both a cp and an mt marker, a total of 945 trees remained, comprising of 24 species trees for 2 genes, 96 species trees for 3 genes, 194 species trees for 4 genes, 246 species trees for 5 genes, 209 species trees for 6 genes, 120 species trees for 7 genes, 45 species trees for 8 genes, 10 species trees for 9 genes, and 1 species trees for 10 genes. For each combination, a representative combination with the highest the MAST% and the common node correlation are shown in the Table 2. The best combination to use for the development of Ulva organellar universal markers should be the combination with the highest values of the two indices and the lowest number of markers in the combination. The combination with five to eight markers has the highest value for the MAST% and the highest value for the common node correlation, but given the number of markers, it might pose more challenges for the development process later. The combination with four markers, psbD, psaA, cox1, cox2, which also has the highest value for the MAST% and has the value for the common node correlation slightly lower than the highest value, is chosen for the next step. This combination comprises of two cp genes, psbD, psaA, and two mt genes, cox1, cox2.",

    "text": "2.2 Selection of Kidney samples\nTo resolve Ulva species phylogenetic relationships, supermatrix and coalescence-based phylogenetic approaches were applied to the chloroplast and mitochondrial datasets. To appreciate the different phylogenetic signals present in the two organellar datasets, the chloroplast and mitochondrial datasets were first analyzed independently. Afterwards, a supermatrix containing both chloroplast and mitochondrial genes was composed in order to infer the Ulva species phylogenetic tree. For the supermatrix Maximum-likelihood (ML) reconstruction, a gene-wise partitioned analysis was performed (Chernomor et al 2016). To estimate the best substitution model of each partition, ML trees were built with IQtree v.2.2.0 (Minh et al 2020) for each single-copy gene, inferring the best model and rate of heterogeneity across sites. All ML analyses were run with 1,000 ultra-fast bootstrap and SH-aLRT branch test replicates. Gene trees were used also for the coalescent-based analyses, using ASTRAL v5.7.8 (Zhang et al 2018), using the multilocus bootstrap support (MLBS) approach. 100 replicates were run (-r) starting from the 1,000 bootstrap trees generated for each gene during the ML analyses, allowing gene and site resampling (–gene-resampling flag). Four metrics were used to assess the concordance of the Ulva species tree reconstructed from supermatrix and coalescence-based analyses obtained from the analyses of chloroplast genes, mitochondrial genes and chloroplast and mitochondrial genes: Robinson-Foulds (Robinson & Foulds 1981), Kuhner-Felsenstein (Kuhner & Felsenstein 1994), Maximum Agreement Subtree (Finden & Gordon 1985) calculated with phangorn package (Schliep 2011), and correlation between the common nodes calculated with corr.dendlist function from dendexted package (Galili 2015). The RF distance measures the number of unique splits between two trees by comparing their bipartitions. It ranges from 0 (identical trees) to a higher value indicating greater dissimilarity with more unique splits (Robinson & Foulds 1981). The KF index quantifies the average genetic differences per site between populations, considering genetic variation within and between populations to provide a quantitative measure of genetic distance (Kuhner & Felsenstein 1994). The MAST (%) identifies the subset of nodes and branches that are common to both trees, disregarding any additional or missing branches. It aims to find the largest possible subtree that can be extracted from both trees while preserving their structural similarities, representing the maximum level of agreement in their branching patterns (Finden & Gordon 1985). The correlation between the common nodes is calculated as the pairwise cophenetic correlation coefficient between the distance matrix and the cophenetic matrix of the common nodes (Galili 2015). Both phangorn and dendextend packages are available in R statistical programming language (R Core Team 2022). Organellar gene ranking To identify the minimum number of genes (markers) necessary to reconstruct the Ulva species tree reconstructed with the 99 chloroplast and mitochondrial markers, Robinson-Foulds, Kuhner-Felsenstein, Maximum Agreement Subtree and correlation between the common nodes metrics were calculated between each of the 99 chloroplast and mitochondrial markers and the Ulva species tree reconstructed from supermatrix analysis. The same approach applied to the Ulva species trees reconstructed using chloroplast and mitochondrial supermatrix and coalesce-based analyses suggested that Maximum Agreement Subtree and common correlation nodes metrics are the best performers to assess phylogenetic tree distances when the tree do not have the same set of tips. The 10 markers (6 chloroplasts and 4 mitochondrial) with the best MAST% and common correlation nodes scores were arbitrarily chosen as candidates for the subsequent combinatorial phylogenetic analyses. Combinatorial phylogenetic analysis For the combinatorial phylogenetic analysis, a custom python script was used to exhaustively calculate the permutations between the chosen 10 marker genes, sampling between 2 and 10 markers. This resulted in the 945 unique combinations of at least a chloroplast and a mitochondrial marker (24 combinations of 2 marker genes, 96 of 3 markers, 194 of 4 markers, 246 of 5 markers, 209 of 6 markers, 120 of 7 markers, 45 of 8 markers, 10 of 9 markers and finally 1 containing all 10 markers genes). For each combination of markers, the script would then independently reconstruct the corresponding phylogenetic tree by invoking IQtree, inferring the best model and rate of heterogeneity across sites, with 1,000 ultra-fast bootstrap and SH-aLRT branch test replicates. Four metrics (RF, KF, MAST% and common correlation nodes scores) between each of the reconstructed 945 tree and the Ulva species tree reconstructed with the 99 chloroplast and mitochondrial markers were calculated in an iterative manner to identify the minimum set of chloroplast and mitochondrial markers necessary to reconstruct a ML phylogenetic tree concordant with the Ulva species tree reconstructed in this study. These markers are suggested to be used as a novel combination of markers to molecularly characterize Ulva species, and universal primers will be designed for each of the markers.",
